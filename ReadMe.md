CHALLENGE 1: A gradient method for the minimization of a
multivariate function
--------------------------------------
This GitBub repository contains the first challenge from PACS course made by Miguel Alca√±iz Moya.
 
The repository contains the code in the main.cpp file, the gradient function defined in the GradientMethod.hpp, the data and parameters taken as example in data.json and the Makefile.

Suggestions on the Makefile
--------------------------------------
Need to add the locations where to find the include and lib files of muparser, muparserx and json.hpp. 
I also used the muparserx interface file "muParserXInterface.hpp" from pacs-examples/Examples/src/muParserInterface
